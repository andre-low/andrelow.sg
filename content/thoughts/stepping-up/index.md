My journey in blue.
{{< /lead >}}

When I first joined the Workers’ Party as a volunteer in 2020, I could not have imagined where this path would lead. Those early days were a blur—distributing flyers in Aljunied GRC during the hustings, having countless doorstep conversations reassuring voters about ballot secrecy, and serving as a polling agent on election day. What began as a desire to make a small contribution to a more balanced political landscape transformed into something much deeper when our unexpected Sengkang GRC win changed everything. Suddenly, I found myself assigned as Secretarial Assistant to MP Louis Chua, facing the real responsibility of serving Singaporeans.

Those three years running Meet-the-People Sessions proved to be the most formative experience of my political journey. Each resident who walked through our doors left an imprint—young single parents juggling work and childcare, seniors navigating our healthcare system, families caught between policy gaps. Each successful appeal gave me added drive, but equally every resident we could not assist in a meaningful way left me feeling helpless—trapped by an imperfect system. With COVID in full force, we had to hit the ground running, and the digital MPS system I built continues serving the Sengkang community today. Alongside our MPS work, I dove into grassroots activities with Louis and the other Sengkang MPs, Ting Ru, and Jamus—food distribution drives, community events, and the uniquely WP experience of selling our Hammer newsletter at hawker centers and markets.

As career demands shifted, so did my contributions. Joining the WP media team allowed me to apply my product experience in new ways, leading the modernisation of our digital presence. February this year saw the launch of our new website after months of careful work. Over the past couple of years, I’ve had the privilege of building up our presence and core volunteer team in Tampines as we seek to break new ground in the upcoming election.

Each step—from nervous first-time volunteer to where I stand today—has deepened my conviction that Singapore benefits from diverse political voices.
This journey has taught me that political participation is not just about policies—it is about people. It is about listening to the elderly uncle worried about healthcare costs, the young couple struggling with housing prices, the mid-career PMET anxious about job security. If these stories resonate with you, I invite you to step up with us. From house visits to polling duties, every role matters—and no experience is needed, just heart and commitment. Whether you can offer time, energy, or resources, your support makes a difference in building a more balanced political system and a brighter future for all Singaporeans. Step up. Make a difference. Walk with us.
