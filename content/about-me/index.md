## Bio

An only child to two MOE teachers, I was taught from a young age to embrace curiosity and ask questions of the world around me.

Today, I am stepping up to build a better future for Singapore, one that embraces diverse perspectives, dares to dream and experiment, and makes sure no Singaporean is ever left behind.
