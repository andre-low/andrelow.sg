Good evening, friends from across Singapore and residents of Jalan Kayu.

I stand before you as someone who has walked your corridors, visited your coffee shops, and listened to your hopes and concerns.

In my first speech, I spoke about why I decided to step up. In my second, I addressed the crisis of affordability that affects so many Singaporean families.

Tonight, as we approach the final days of this campaign, I want to speak about another crisis facing our nation—a crisis of accountability—and the future we can build together with fresh ideas and new perspectives.

## A different kind of candidate

My opponent has suggested that his NTUC experience and leadership is what Jalan Kayu needs. I respect Mr Ng’s service. But this election isn’t just about experience—it’s about what kind of experience we need in Parliament.

He has three stars to his name from his distinguished military career. I have none. But what I offer is something different: a breadth of private sector experience across law, consulting, and technology. Fresh perspectives. New ideas. And most importantly, a commitment to being accountable to you.

Because in Singapore today, we need more than just experienced leaders. We need leaders who understand the value of transparency.

## The accountability crisis

In recent months, Singaporeans have witnessed troubling examples of what happens when accountability is lacking.

A PAP minister once famously remarked, and I paraphrase, that “no one has asked for an apology.” Well, tonight, let’s ask.

When the SimplyGo rollout left thousands of commuters stranded...

[To audience] Where is our apology?

When the East-West line broke down in September, disrupting the lives of countless Singaporeans for days...

[To audience] Where is our apology?

When the ACRA Bizfile NRIC scandal exposed our personal data...

[To audience] Where is our apology?

When MOE’s vendor Mobile Guardian deleted our children’s critical notes just before exams...

[To audience] Where is our apology?

Sometimes apologies do come, but they often feel like “sorry you were affected” rather than genuine accountability.

These aren’t just isolated incidents. They reflect a system that has grown too comfortable, too certain of its own infallibility. When even respected figures like former NTUC Income CEO Tan Suee Chieh feel compelled to speak up about governance concerns, we must acknowledge that something needs to change.

The Workers’ Party believes in a Singapore where decisions are made transparently, where leaders take responsibility, and where the people’s voice matters.

## Estate management you can trust

To Jalan Kayu residents in the crowd, some may wonder: “Can the Workers’ Party handle town management?”

Let me be clear: If elected, you will see no disruption in services. The Workers’ Party has proven its ability to run town councils effectively in Aljunied, Hougang, and Sengkang. I will tap into this wealth of experience and hit the ground running from day one.

I understand your daily concerns—the need for functioning lifts, well-maintained walkways, and clean common spaces. These aren’t just amenities; they’re essential to your quality of life.

## Building a better future

Beyond managing our estate, I want to help build a future that works for all Singaporeans.

A future where education nurtures creativity and critical thinking rather than just producing test-takers. Singapore’s children need an education system that prepares them for tomorrow’s challenges, not yesterday’s. We need broad-based, multidisciplinary learning that encourages exploration and innovation.

A future where our young people develop an explorer’s mindset—where they connect dots others can’t see and innovate where others see problems. This isn’t about diluting specialisation; it’s about enriching it. It’s about creating thinkers who work across disciplines to address the challenges we will face in an increasingly complex world.

A future where Singaporeans are empowered with the digital skills and tools they need to thrive in an AI-driven economy. Where SkillsFuture isn’t just about catching up, but about leaping forward.

A future where we value diverse pathways to success—whether through academia, entrepreneurship, or the trades—recognising that our nation needs all these talents to flourish.

## A voice that speaks for you

In Parliament, I will be a voice that speaks for you. Not just when it’s convenient, but when it matters most.

I’m not one to mince words when I see something that doesn’t sit quite right with me. And why should I? Singaporeans deserve someone who will ask the tough questions, someone who will speak up when others stay silent.

When bills are rushed through without adequate scrutiny, I will ask the hard questions.

When policies benefit the wealthy while burdening ordinary Singaporeans, I will stand firm.

And when government agencies make mistakes that affect your lives, I will demand accountability—not out of spite, but because you deserve nothing less.

We navigate uncertainty not by how fast we pass laws or how many laws we pass. We do so by exercising prudence, due diligence, and careful deliberation. If need be, we are ready to work across the aisle, as we always have. This is to ensure that our country does right by you, by our citizens.

## The choice before us

On the 3rd of May, you have a choice.

You can vote for more of the same. Or you can vote for a future where your concerns are heard, where your children have the freedom to explore and create, where your family’s needs come first.

Jalan Kayu deserves a representative who offers fresh perspectives while understanding your daily struggles. Someone who speaks up not to score political points, but to ensure your voice matters in our democracy.

I am that representative. The Workers’ Party is that alternative.

My name is Andre Low. I’m offering something different—accountability, transparency, and a genuine commitment to serving you and your families.

Vote for change. Vote for hope. Vote for the Workers’ Party, and join us in working for Singapore!

Thank you.
