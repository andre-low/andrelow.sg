Our wealth Gini stands at 0.55 — higher than our income Gini, and likely an underestimate.\nWealth and income inequality are distinct problems requiring distinct solutions. Wealth compounds across a lifetime and passes down across generations. MOF\u0026rsquo;s own data shows social mobility is moderating — among children born to fathers in the bottom 20 per cent, the proportion who remained stuck in that bracket increased across successive cohorts. The ladder is still there. But the rungs are getting further apart.\nThe Child Development Account has one great feature: the First Step Grant is automatic. But the CDA is designed for money to be spent — on healthcare and childcare — not saved. And its most substantial feature, co-matching of up to $15,000, accrues only to families who can afford to deposit first. The families who need the most help benefit the least.\nI propose Singapore study the introduction of a Baby Bond: a universal state-endowed account opened automatically at birth, invested in a diversified, low-cost portfolio over 18 years. If directed to Singapore equities, it gives every Singaporean child a stake in the nation. Time and compounding do the heavy lifting. A meaningful endowment, invested early, becomes real capital by adulthood.\nThree design principles. One: a universal starting grant—the same base endowment for every child. After all, we are all equal at birth. Two: public funding only, no private contributions. The UK\u0026rsquo;s Child Trust Fund allowed private top-ups and ended up compounding the advantage of families already ahead. Three: withdrawals restricted to wealth-building uses — education, entrepreneurship, housing, or retirement savings.\nOne more reason this is timely. The CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme launches in 2028. A Baby Bond built on the same lifecycle investment logic could roll over directly into the LRIS at maturity — potentially structured as an extension of the same scheme, drawing on the same commercial providers.\nA hypothetical $5,000 endowment, compounded over a lifetime, could become $200,000 at age 65, if using a conservative lifecycle approach. Or $400,000 or more, if using a more aggressive, equities-only strategy.\nChairman, I ask the Prime Minister\u0026rsquo;s Office to commission a feasibility study on a Baby Bond scheme for Singapore. It will be a useful arrow in our quiver to tackle wealth inequality.\n","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/baby-bonds/","section":"Speeches","summary":"","title":"Baby bonds to tackle wealth inequality and boost total fertility rate","type":"speeches"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/budget-2026/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Budget 2026","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/committee-of-supply/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Committee of Supply","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fertility/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fertility","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/industrial-policy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Industrial Policy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/jobs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Jobs","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/lifelong-learning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Lifelong Learning","type":"tags"},{"content":" The experienced professionals of 2046 are the junior hires of today. If we do not hire them today, we will not have them in twenty years. Mr Speaker,\nThe Prime Minister has set out an ambitious vision for AI. He asks us to harness it as a strategic advantage. I agree with that framing. The question I want to put to this House today is: a strategic advantage for whom? The answer will determine whether Budget 2026 fulfils its promise—that growth must translate into good jobs and rising incomes for Singaporeans.\nI want to address three things. How we can own the technology rather than just rent it. How we protect the worker who is being asked to adapt. And how we ensure the gains are shared with the people who helped create them.\nPart one: From fast adopter to global exporter—Singapore’s AI industrial strategy # Let me start with the technology itself.\nMr Speaker, I want to push our AI ambition further. Right now the heavy fiscal levers in our AI strategy are largely weighted towards adoption—identifying where AI can improve our existing industries and subsidising our businesses to deploy it faster. That is necessary, but not sufficient. If our industrial strategy remains focused on fast adoption, we are agreeing to a permanent, compounding transfer of value to foreign technology monopolies. Every API call, every subscription, every enterprise licence, is rent paid to a landlord in Silicon Valley, year after year. Singapore has never just accepted that kind of relationship with any industry. We move up the value chain, extracting value at the source. We do not just use semiconductors—we make them. Our ambition for AI should be no different: we need to stake out our own defendable positions, and capture the value that comes with them.\nThe question is where, specifically, we have a right to win. And I think the answer starts with understanding our constraints.\nWe cannot win a compute war. We lack the land, the power grid, and the capital to train trillion-parameter frontier models. But Singapore has been here before. When we faced constraints in other industries, we did not try to outspend larger competitors. We identified niches where our specific combination of capabilities gave us an advantage, and we built from there.\nWe have already done this once in AI. Singapore has produced SEA-LION and MERaLION—large language models built on open-weights foundations, fine-tuned for Southeast Asian languages and our cultural context. We identified a gap in the region, and we filled it. That was and is the right instinct. We must now look further afield, with global ambitions.\nThe case for Edge AI # I want to make the case for another niche, one with global export potential: Edge AI, and the efficiency research that underpins it.\nThe rest of the world is running into the same energy wall we face. Data centres are straining electrical grids everywhere. The United States is planning new nuclear plants specifically to power AI infrastructure. My colleague Dennis Tan earlier highlighted the outsize environmental impact of an indiscriminate rush to embrace large-scale models for every minor task—a dilemma every nation is grappling with.\nThe global problem, in other words, is the same problem our constraints have been forcing us to think about: how do you make AI run on less?\nThis is the field of model distillation and quantisation—compressing large AI models so they can run locally, with minimal degradation in performance, without an internet connection to the cloud, on a fraction of the energy. The result is what practitioners call Edge AI: intelligence that runs on the device itself, rather than routing data to a distant server.\nThe Prime Minister announced four National AI Missions in this Budget. I want to look at two of them through the lens of Edge AI.\nIn advanced manufacturing, the robots on a factory floor cannot depend on a cloud connection. A production line that hesitates because of network latency, or halts because of an outage, is a competitive liability. The AI running that factory needs to operate locally, and be resilient to disruption.\nIn connectivity, the autonomous systems managing containers at our ports make thousands of routing and sequencing decisions every second. Our ports handle a huge proportion of the world’s transshipment traffic. Those decisions cannot wait for a round trip to a data centre.\nThe export opportunity follows directly. As the rest of the world scrambles to solve their energy and latency constraints, the software that makes AI run efficiently on local hardware will command a significant premium. We are already being pushed toward solving this problem. We should be solving it deliberately, with an eye on selling the solution.\nI am not a deep technical expert, and I am not offering a comprehensive blueprint today. What I am suggesting is a way of thinking about where Singapore has a right to win—and Edge AI is one possible answer to that question—among many others.\nThe same logic points toward explainable AI: building tools that make AI reasoning transparent enough for regulated industries to deploy. Finance and healthcare, the two other sectors that are the focus of our AI missions, are industries that operate under obligations to explain automated decisions. Singapore’s regulatory institutions and our reputation for rule of law may give us a genuine advantage in that space. These are just ideas. There will be other niches neither side of this House has yet identified.\nSo what do I ask for?\nThe ask # The Government has committed $37 billion under the Research, Innovation, and Enterprise 2030 plan (‘RIE2030’), with AI explicitly in scope. I ask that within that envelope, Edge AI efficiency research—model distillation, quantisation, and on-device deployment—be named as an explicit priority, with success measured by commercial export potential, not just domestic adoption.\nMy more specific ask concerns the National AI Missions. The four Missions are already funded. I ask that each Mission consider edge deployment capability as a key design criterion: whether an efficient, low-latency, sovereign edge model is appropriate for the use case.\nAnd more broadly: I ask that the government establish a formal process for identifying Singapore’s AI export niches—applying the same constraint-aware logic that produced SEA-LION and MERaLION—across our strategic industries. Not just edge AI. Not just explainable AI. A systematic search for where Singapore has a right to win, and a commitment to back those niches with capital.\nThe goal? To ensure that in years to come, Singapore is a genuine owner of commercial AI capability that we export to the world. Not just a well-compensated tenant, but a landlord of our own.\nPart two: The broken rung—protecting the next generation’s career ladder # But owning the technology is only the first part of the answer. The second is protecting the people being asked to adapt to it—including those the market has already started to leave behind.\nMr Speaker, the aggregate economic data looks encouraging. Broad-based wage growth. Lower income inequality. But averages can be dangerous. They can mask a specific problem that I think deserves more attention than it is currently receiving.\nResearch published in October last year by Stanford and ADP found that since late 2022, when ChatGPT broke cover, entry-level hiring in AI-exposed sectors in the US has fallen by 16%. For software developers aged 22 to 25 specifically, headcount has collapsed by 20%. We do not have such granular data for Singapore, but that alone is part of the problem.\nI call this the broken bottom rung.\nI want to be clear about what is at stake here. Not in economic terms—in human terms.\nThe first job is not just income. It is the place where you discover what you are capable of. Where someone more senior takes a chance on you, teaches you something you could not have learned any other way, and passes on a standard of craft or judgement that you will carry for the rest of your career. It is where professional identity is formed.\nIf that rung is gone—not because graduates are less capable, but simply because it is now cheaper to automate the tasks that used to justify hiring them—we do not just have an unemployment problem. We have a rupture in how knowledge and expertise pass from one generation to the next. The experienced professionals of 2046 are the junior hires of today. If we do not hire them today, we will not have them in twenty years.\nAfter my parliamentary colleague Eileen and I put out a call for feedback some months ago, we heard from many young Singaporeans who are living this. Graduates who applied for over a hundred roles. Who took unpaid internships hoping it would lead somewhere. Who are talented, willing, and being told by the market that there is simply no place for them yet. They are not asking for sympathy. They are asking for the chance to start.\nThe broken rung is the most visible symptom. But the disruption does not stop at the entry level. Workers mid-career face a parallel challenge: skills that took years to build, being absorbed by AI faster than retraining programmes can respond.\nSo what do I ask for?\nData first # We cannot manage what we do not measure. I call on MOM to publish granular employment data for new graduates, broken down by sector, role type, and AI-exposure level. If the broken rung is happening here, we need to see it in our own numbers before we can respond to it.\nMake the EIS deduction conditional on the graduate hiring pipeline # The Government’s 400% Enterprise Innovation Scheme (‘EIS’) tax deduction for AI expenditure is a powerful lever. While the details are being firmed up, I ask that the Government require that firms claiming the EIS deduction—above a meaningful threshold—demonstrate a credible plan for maintaining graduate and entry-level pipelines—not by preserving roles that AI has genuinely made redundant, but by investing in reimagining what junior work looks like in an AI-augmented firm. Public money for AI adoption should come with a commitment to developing the workers who will work alongside it.\nAI tool subscriptions # The Government’s announcement of six months of free premium AI tool access for workers taking selected courses is a genuinely welcome step. But six months is a trial. Mastery takes longer. AI is not a course you complete—it is a daily practice, the way using a word processor or a spreadsheet is a daily practice. A worker who builds that habit over six months and then has the access removed is being set up to fall behind again.\nThe Workers’ Party has called for SkillsFuture credits to cover AI tool subscriptions on an ongoing basis. I renew that call today—for young workers starting out, for those mid-career who need to stay current, and for our senior workers looking to embrace new technologies.\nLower the mid-career qualifying age to 35 # The SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme currently targets workers aged 40 and above. But the disruption is hitting earlier. Singaporeans in their mid-to-late thirties—the millennial cohort whose careers were built on skills that AI is now absorbing—are facing displacement before they even qualify for mid-career support. Lowering the qualifying age to 35 would be a concrete, targeted step that addresses where the disruption is actually occurring.\nPart three: Rewriting the social contract for the AI age # That brings me to the third and final question.\nAI is not just changing how we work. It is changing what we owe each other. The assumptions baked into our social contract—about risk, about reward, about the relationship between capital and labour—were written for a different economy. Budget 2026 is an opportunity to update them.\nSo what do I ask for?\nRedundancy insurance # The Workers’ Party has called for Redundancy Insurance across multiple Parliaments. I argued for it myself in my maiden speech. I will not repeat the full argument today, but I want to offer a different frame for it.\nCritics have called it a welfare crutch. I want to make the opposite case: Redundancy Insurance is the engine of the economic agility this Budget demands.\nA worker with six months of financial breathing room can say yes to retraining. They can take the risk of moving sectors. They can be the bold, adaptable Singaporean the Government is asking them to be. Without that buffer, the rational response to uncertainty is not agility—it is paralysis, or grabbing the first job that comes along, plugging them into a cycle of underemployment. And paralysis is exactly what we cannot afford in an economy undergoing structural transformation.\nThe Government is rightly optimistic about AI’s potential. But responsible governance requires managing for all outcomes, including the downside. Redundancy Insurance is that hedge. I urge the Government to act on it.\nRetraining tax credits—the incentive update # The EIS deduction condition I proposed earlier—on maintaining graduate and entry-level pipelines—addresses new workers entering the workforce. But there is a parallel question about existing workers: what happens to the person already in the job when AI arrives?\nRight now, the tax system is neutral on this question. A firm can deploy AI to augment its workforce, or to replace it—and incentives are often available either way. Without a nudge, the default logic of capital is to substitute labour. Labour is expensive. Shareholders benefit when headcount falls. AI makes substitution easier than it has ever been.\nI propose a targeted Retraining Tax Credit: available only to firms that can demonstrate they have reskilled a specific worker into an AI-augmented role, rather than retrenching them. Retention, done right, costs less than redundancy. Let us make the fiscal system reflect that.\nThe AI gains audit # Which brings me, finally, to the distribution question.\nGlobal evidence consistently shows that productivity gains from AI do not automatically translate into wage growth. The gains can flow to capital—to shareholders—while workers on the same payroll see no change in take-home pay.\nThe Government is investing taxpayer resources and regulatory sandboxes in four National AI Missions: advanced manufacturing, connectivity, finance, and healthcare. These are the right priorities. But they come with a public obligation.\nI propose an annual AI Gains Audit, scoped specifically to these four sectors. Not red tape for every business. Not a surveillance regime on private enterprise. A targeted accountability mechanism for sectors receiving extraordinary levels of public support—to answer one straightforward question: are the productivity gains from state-backed AI Missions flowing into the wages of our workers, or are they flowing into shareholder returns?\nParliament and the public have a right to know the answer.\nConclusion # Mr Speaker, this is a Budget with genuine ambition, and the Workers’ Party supports much of its direction.\nBut ambition must come with accountability. The strategic advantage of AI must be felt in the wages of our workers—not just in the earnings reports of the companies deploying the technology.\nOwn the technology, not just rent it. Protect the worker who is being asked to adapt. Ensure the gains of AI accrue to workers, not capital owners.\nThese are not obstacles to Singapore’s AI ambitions. They are the conditions that make those ambitions worth pursuing.\nThank you, Mr Speaker.\n","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/making-ai-work-for-the-singapore-worker/","section":"Speeches","summary":"","title":"Making AI work for the Singaporean worker","type":"speeches"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/parliament/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Parliament","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/retirement-adequacy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Retirement Adequacy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/","section":"Speeches","summary":"","title":"Speeches","type":"speeches"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tax-incentives/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tax Incentives","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/wealth-inequality/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wealth Inequality","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/workers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Workers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/youths/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Youths","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fire-safety/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fire Safety","type":"tags"},{"content":" We are subsidising the installation of new fire hazards in 2026. This isn\u0026rsquo;t legacy infrastructure we\u0026rsquo;re managing—it\u0026rsquo;s a new risk we\u0026rsquo;re actively creating. Mr Speaker,\nToday I wish to speak on the topic of fire safety in our homes.\nWhen I read about the Wang Fuk Court tragedy in Hong Kong, Grenfell Tower in London, or even the Le Constellation bar fire in Switzerland just a couple of weeks ago—I think: these are world-class cities. Cities with resources. Cities with regulations. And yet, fire found a way.\nTo me, a fire feels different from other disasters. Earthquakes feel distant. Typhoons feel abstract. But a smoke-filled corridor feels immediate. It feels like it could happen to us. I would venture that many other Singaporeans feel similarly.\nFire fatalities rose from 3 in 2023 to 5 in 2024. By August 2025, we had already recorded at least 8 deaths. While this may be a statistical blip—given the small numbers—it’s a sobering reminder that fire remains an ever present danger.\nTo be clear, I believe that Singapore has strong fire safety standards. Our HDB flats are designed as fire compartments to delay the spread of fire. Our Singapore Civil Defence Force is well trained and effective. Our building and fire codes are well thought out and comprehensive.\nBut our good standards make continued vigilance all the more important. I am glad to hear that the Government has started a review of existing fire safety regulations governing building construction and maintenance work. But we must not limit ourselves to just the lessons from Wang Fuk Court, tragic as it was. We must also be cognisant of other hidden dangers, whether they are established practices that have become collective blind spots or new emerging risks that require novel approaches.\nToday I want to address three areas where I think we can close important gaps:\nFirst, barriers to egress; second, battery fires we invite into our homes, and third, the widening gap in fire safety standards across generations of flats.\nLet me take each in turn.\nPart one: The locked gate # Mr Speaker, there’s an anomaly in our Fire Code worth examining.\nClause 2.3.9(a) of the SCDF Fire Code (2023) mandates that exit doors must be openable ‘without the use of a key, tool, or special knowledge’ from the inside. This is sound policy—in a panic, people fumble. Seconds matter. But this clause specifically exempts residential units.\nSo the standard we apply to malls and offices is deemed optional for our own homes. This is a deliberate policy choice. The question is whether we should revisit it.\nFor decades, HDB flats came standard with wrought iron entrance gates secured by double cylinder locks, sometimes known as ‘key-to-key’ locks—that is locks that require a key to open from either side.\nIn 2019, HDB transitioned new BTO projects to mild-steel gates with a single cylinder lock with an interior thumb turn that allows for easier egress in an emergency.1 Residents within their flats do not need to fumble for a key to get out. These gates are designed such that it is difficult for a prospective intruder to reach around the bars and operate the thumb turn from the outside.\nThis is a positive development, but it also means that millions of flats still have legacy double cylinder locks. For decades, concerns about intruders overrode fire safety. I understand the logic. But this sometimes comes at a heavy cost.\nOn 13 August 2025, a fire broke out at Block 106 Jalan Bukit Merah. A couple in their 30s were seen at the kitchen window shouting for help. Neighbours crawled through smoke to reach them but were stopped by the locked entrance gate. Unfortunately the couple were found unconscious by firefighters and later died in hospital. We will never know if the locked gate might have been the decisive factor.\nAnd there’s a compounding factor: we often install additional padlocks on our gates. A big, chunky padlock is a feature on many entrance gates. So now you have two locks. Two keys. Two points of failure. In a smoke-filled flat, fumbling for one key is difficult enough.\nThen there are window grilles. Many households install keyed grilles to prevent falls from height. But over time, keys get lost, or the grilles are not designed to be opened at all. Which means when firefighters arrive with a ladder—another potential exit is sealed shut.\nWhat is slightly confounding, is that we are hyper-cognisant of the threats to egress faced by new technologies. We now require digital locks on fire-rated doors to be certified—recognising the egress risk. Yet for established practices like keyed entrance gates and window grilles, we’ve normalised a clear safety deviance.\nI would also like to touch briefly on the HIP—the Home Improvement Programme. Right now, as part of the HIP, HDB residents have the option to replace their old gates with a mild steel gate with an interior thumb-turn, much like those installed in new BTOs. Critically, this is a paid, optional improvement, and is not part of the ‘essential improvements’ package. But more worryingly, I believe that HDB continues to offer—and subsidise—the installation of new wrought-iron gates with a double cylinder lock as an alternative option.\nThat is, we offer residents the option to replace an old gate—that is a fire risk—with a new gate—that is also a fire risk! We are subsidising the installation of new fire hazards in 2026. This isn’t legacy infrastructure we’re managing—it’s a new risk we’re actively creating.\nSo it would seem, there is an easy path to addressing this risk. Here are my suggestions:\nOne: Make the installation of a new entrance gate with an interior thumb turn an ‘essential improvement’ under the HIP scheme—fully subsidised, not optional. Wrought iron gates with double cylinder locks should also no longer be offered as an option.\nTwo: Forbid the pre-installation by developers of gates with double cylinder locks on new-build housing. Easy egress should be the default option. Residents that prefer double cylinder locks will have to make the choice to install them themselves.\nThree: Develop a phased replacement plan for legacy gates with double cylinder locks for estates that are not close to a HIP exercise, prioritising older estates.\nFour: Incorporate the risks of keyed gates, additional padlocks, and sealed window grilles into public education campaigns on fire safety.\nPart two: Battery fires # I will now address the outsize danger of battery fires.\nAMD fires—Active Mobility Devices—rose 21.8% in 2024 to 67 cases. Personal Mobility Aids saw a dramatic 120% spike.2 When we banned PMDs from footpaths, users migrated to modified mobility scooters with dubious batteries. The risk merely transferred.\nThe new year has just begun, and AMD fires are already hitting the headlines. Just last Friday (9 January 2026), 4 people were hospitalised following a PMA fire in Tampines. As for the fatal Bukit Merah fire from last August. SCDF findings indicated the blaze likely originated from a PMD battery pack in the living room.3\nLithium-ion battery fires are different: thermal runaway—a self-sustaining chemical reaction that releases toxic fumes and jet-like flames that breach fire compartments make them extra deadly. The intensity builds in seconds, giving residents little time to react, or fumble for a key. Standard residential fire extinguishers are often useless.\nWe tell residents not to fight these fires themselves.4 Yet we expect them to store, charge, and manage these devices in their bedrooms and living rooms.\nOn my estate walks, residents share their fear of their neighbours’ AMDs being charged right by their front door. A ticking time bomb that may one day trap them in their own homes. Not much can be done to assuage their fears, as such charging practices are, as things stand, by and large permitted.\nThe reality is this, trying to enforce ‘compliant batteries’ is futile when e-commerce makes cheap imports trivial. The Land Transport and Related Matters Bill tabled today doubles down on regulation, but is unlikely to solve the enforcement gap.\nOur current approach treats this as a compliance problem—’use certified batteries’—when it’s fundamentally an infrastructure problem. So these are my proposals:\nOne: Push for battery swapping systems, like the model made popular by Taiwanese firm Gogoro. Batteries charged in controlled, outdoor environments. This serves both safety and sustainability.\nTwo: Build public charging hubs for AMDs, perhaps co-located with EV chargers at HDB carparks. Equip them with fire suppression, thermal monitoring, and make them faster and cheaper than home charging. Create the incentive for residents to charge outside of the home.\nThree: Implement periodic inspections of AMDs, including batteries, with enforced replacement timelines as batteries degrade.\nOnce sufficient infrastructure is built out, and residents learn new habits, it may then actually be viable to outlaw the charging of PMDs and PABs within homes entirely—eliminating the safety risk.\nI do not believe we can regulate our way out of the risk posed by AMD fires with inspections and battery compliance rules alone. We need that, combined with a push for better infrastructure.\nPart three: The equity question # Mr Speaker, fire safety in Singapore varies by when your block was built. Newer BTOs have fire-rated doors, thumb-turn gates, and multiple redundant evacuation routes. Older blocks sometimes have single-staircase designs, enclosed corridors that trap smoke, and densely packed flats.\nOn 29 July 2025, a fire broke out on the 10th floor of Block 229, Toa Payoh Lorong 8. The fire was so intense it shattered windows and spread vertically to the 11th floor. Flames breached the very compartmentation our flats are designed around.\nWhen firefighters arrived, they discovered that the dry riser was not in proper working condition. Water could not be charged up to the affected floors. Firefighters had to manually haul hoses up 10 storeys via the staircase.\nThis represents a maintenance challenge. Infrastructure doesn’t just age—it degrades. And testing regimes may not catch all failure modes between annual checks.\nNow let me address the single-staircase question.\nBlock 229 is a 25-storey point block with only a single staircase. Residents trapped above the burning unit had to flee upward—to the 24th floor—because the single staircase near the fire became impassable. Elderly residents had limited options. Some sheltered in place whilst black smoke seeped into their homes. Others relied on neighbours for assistance. Seven people were hospitalised, including a firefighter and a child.\nThis is not an isolated pattern. Several fires in the last years were in blocks with single-staircase configurations where the most direct escape route was compromised.\nAnd here’s the equity dimension: we have our most elderly, least mobile residents living in buildings with older infrastructure and design standards from an earlier era. Those least able to move quickly in an emergency are disproportionately living in housing with older safety features.\nIncome can also be a factor, many rental blocks feature densely packed flats and enclosed corridors.\nWe can do more to protect these residents. So here’s what I propose:\nOne: Consider ‘Fire Escape Viability’—presence of single-point egress, enclosed corridors—as one factor in VERS selection for redevelopment.\nTwo: Expand free installation of Home Fire Alarm Devices to all older flats. Prioritise older estates, and those with more elderly residents.\nThree: Roll out sprinkler systems in common areas of older blocks systematically, not just as pilots. Prioritise blocks with enclosed corridors, and densely packed flats.\nFour: Implement more rigorous inspection regimes for fire-fighting infrastructure—wet risers, dry risers, booster pumps—with published compliance rates and mandatory remediation timelines.\nFive: Provide Town Councils with clearer enforcement mandates and more monetary resources and support to maintain safety standards and keep fire safety infrastructure in good working order.\nConclusion # Mr Speaker, let me bring this together.\nI have discussed three areas where we can do better: barriers to egress, battery fires we invite into our homes, and widening gaps across generations of flats.\nSafety should not depend on when your block was built, whether you can afford an upgrade, or which estate you call home.\nSingapore has built a strong fire safety system. Our HDB flats are well-designed. Our SCDF is world-class. Our fire codes are comprehensive. We continue to improve with each new development.\nOur task now is to ensure that excellence reaches every home—and that we continue this commitment regardless of age or estate maturity.\nMake fire safety non-negotiable—not optional, not estate-dependent, not income-dependent.

Mr Speaker,\nBefore I begin, I would like to first declare that I work for a financial technology company that may fall under the definition of online service provider as envisaged in this bill.\nThe Workers’ Party understands the motivation behind this Bill, and we deeply wish to support it. But we have some reservations.\nMs He Ting Ru has addressed the first question this Bill raises: Will it adequately protect victims? She has outlined how we can strengthen that protection, particularly for vulnerable victims. I support those amendments.\nI address the second question: Will this Bill be fair, accountable, and properly calibrated in its exercise of power?\nThis Bill grants the Commissioner significant authority—to issue directions, compel removal of content, impose obligations on service providers, and reduce engagement with material without the creator’s knowledge. These are necessary powers to address real harms. But they are also powers that should be carefully designed for their intended purpose, and appropriately constrained by institutional checks and balances.\nI will address three amendments that address our concerns about the Bill’s architecture, and six areas requiring ministerial clarification.\nLet me begin with our amendments.\nFirst, raising the threshold for state action.\nClause 26 sets the threshold at which the Commissioner may issue directions. The current text reads: “reason to suspect”.\nWe believe that threshold is too low. Too low for the powers being granted. \u0026lsquo;Reason to suspect\u0026rsquo; is a subjective test. It permits action based on intuition or preliminary information, without requiring objective evidence.\nOur amendment raises this to “reasonable grounds to believe”. This is the same standard used in comparable legislation overseas, including the United Kingdom’s Online Safety Act 2023 and Canada\u0026rsquo;s proposed bill C-63 on online harms. This requires evidence that would satisfy a reasonable person, not merely a suspicion.\nSome may argue this is semantics. We do not believe this is so. In the UK Act, they expressly distinguish between “reasonable grounds to suspect” for beginning an investigation and “reasonable grounds to believe” for taking enforcement action. We believe that this is the right approach. The former permits inquiry. The latter permits coercion. That distinction matters.\nIf we are serious about protecting victims, we must be equally serious about ensuring the Commissioner’s enforcement powers rest on evidence, not suspicion. Our amendment achieves both.\nThe second set of amendments I will be addressing concern legitimate discourse.\nClauses 9, 11, and 19 define three online harms. Online harassment. Non-consensual disclosure of private information. Instigation of disproportionate harm. These definitions are necessary. But we think they are incomplete.\nLet me give three scenarios:\nA citizen posts fair criticism of a public official’s conduct. If a reasonable person would conclude that criticism is “abusive” or “insulting” and is likely to cause the official “distress”, under clause 9, this could be harassment.\nA victim of harassment publishes text messages from their harasser online—as a call for help, as a warning to others. Under Clause 11, this could be non-consensual disclosure of private information.\nA journalist publishes leaked documents exposing corruption in a government-linked entity, but under Clause 11, this could also fall under the definition of non-consensual disclosure.\nMr Speaker, I do not suggest these outcomes are intended. But the Bill as drafted seems to permit them. The definitions contain minimal carve-outs. There are no obvious exclusions for public interest, and they do not go far enough in recognising that not all disclosures of private information are harmful, and not all uncomfortable speech is harassment.\nOur amendments insert these safeguards.\nFor Clause 9, we add: communication is not harassment if it constitutes fair comment on a matter of public interest. This is drawn from the established common law defence to the tort of defamation.\nFor Clause 11, we add: disclosure does not fall within the definition if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in privacy. We list seven examples, including exposing wrongdoing, informing the public on matters of significant concern, and protecting public health and safety. This amendment is modelled on a well established balancing test in other common law jurisdictions, including the UK. As drafted, it is also very similar to the test as codified in the Australian Privacy Act.\nFor Clause 19, we add: communication does not constitute instigation if it relates to a matter of public interest.\nThese amendments do not weaken the Bill. They sharpen it. They ensure the Commissioner’s powers are used to protect victims, not to chill legitimate speech. They prevent this Bill from inadvertently silencing criticism, investigative journalism, or public-interest disclosures.\nThe third set of amendments establishes independent oversight.\nThe Bill establishes an internal appeal mechanism. Clause 60 creates an Appeal Panel whose members are appointed by the Minister. Clause 63 provides the right to appeal Commissioner decisions to an Appeal Committee drawn from this Panel. Crucially, Clause 63(5) and (6) state that “no further appeal[s]” will be permitted beyond the Appeal Committee. This makes a Ministerially-appointed committee the final arbiter.\nOur amendment deletes Clause 63(5) and (6) and inserts a new Clause C establishing a right of appeal to the General Division of the High Court.\nThe proposed appeal is not unlimited. It is confined to three grounds: a point of law, that the harmful activity did not occur, or that compliance is not technically feasible. Now this is similar to the appeal mechanism in POFMA. This ensures the courts do not become a general review body for every single Commissioner decision, but remain available as an independent check on questions of legality, fact, and feasibility.\nMr Speaker, this is not about distrusting the Commissioner or the Minister. This is about institutional design. When the state exercises coercive power—power that could affect livelihoods, reputations, and businesses—there must be a route to independent judicial appeals of cases.\nSo some may say that our proposed amendments may introduce additional burdens on the courts. I also appreciate MOS Rahayu and Minister Tong’s earlier clarifications as to the policy considerations at play here.\nMOS Rahayu referred to the inherent right of judicial review, which is still available as there is no ouster clause within the Bill. We appreciate that judicial review is always available, but the scope is generally limited to the process of the Commission in making the decisions and not about the merits of the case itself. The proposed amendment we have tabled is very limited in scope. It proposes expanding this right of appeal to the courts, to three limited grounds. We understand that balance needs to be struck and we are striving to achieve that.\nA brief reference to Minister Tong’s suggestions that there may be a David and Goliath situation when we avail of appeals to the courts. We believe that the existing provisions within the bill as drafted, notably section 63, subsection four, which provides that there is no automatic stay on directions even when an appeal process is proceeding, helps to ameliorate that concern. There will be no continuing harm to victims as the appeals process is proceeding. Furthermore, when we avail of the courts, there are mechanisms that can address some of these concerns as well, such as in-camera, private proceedings, as well as gag orders to protect the identities of victims.\nMr Speaker, beyond these three amendments, I turn now to six areas where the Bill requires clarification from the Minister.\nFirst, the scope of doxxing.\nClause 10 defines doxxing as publishing identity information where “a reasonable person would conclude was likely to have been intended to cause harassment, alarm, distress or humiliation” to the victim.\nHere is my concern: A victim identifies their hitherto anonymous harasser online to warn others in the community. Could a reasonable person conclude this was “intended to cause” the harasser distress or alarm? The victim’s intent may be protective, but the effect—and perhaps the foreseeable effect—is to cause the harasser alarm.\nThe Bill does not answer this, so I ask the Minister: Will victims who expose their harassers in this manner be caught by Clause 10? If not, what safeguards exist in the Bill’s design to prevent this?\nSecond, standing to appeal when directions are given to platforms.\nClause 28 sets out who receives Part 5 directions. Some directions—stop communication, restraining—can be issued directly to the communicator. But others—access disabling, account restriction, engagement reduction—are issued to platforms or administrators. When a direction is not issued to the communicator directly, can they still appeal? Clause 61(1)(e) allows the recipient to appeal. But the communicator is not the recipient. Clause 61(1)(f) says they may appeal only if they fall within a description the Minister “may” prescribe under Clause 82.\nI ask the Minister: Will regulations be made to ensure that communicators have standing to appeal directions that restrict their content, even if those directions were not issued directly to them? Or will this remain subject to Ministerial discretion?\nThird, the meaning of “prescribed connection to Singapore”.\nI understand MOS Rahayu has addressed this example. She has given the example of long-term residents in Singapore who will fall under the ambit of this provision. We would like to seek further clarifications. It is clear that citizens, PRs, and long-term residents are eligible to make a report. We would like to understand what else the ambit of prescribed connection in Singapore could mean. Does it cover a foreign spouse on a Long-Term Visit Pass, harassed by someone in Singapore? Does it cover a former Singapore resident, who has now moved overseas, who is still being targeted by the Singapore-based individual?\nI ask the Minister: Who is protected by this Bill? Who is excluded? What will “prescribed connection” mean when the regulations are eventually drafted?\nFourth, the exemption for public agencies.\nClause 4(2) states that public agencies cannot be given directions or orders under Part 5. Part 5 contains the Commissioner’s enforcement powers—stop communication directions, access disabling directions, restraining directions, and so on. This means that if harmful content originates from, is hosted by, or is facilitated by a public agency, the Commissioner cannot compel that agency to act.\nClause 4(3) goes further: public agencies cannot be sued under the civil proceedings provisions in Parts 10, 11, and 12.\nMr Speaker, online harm is online harm, regardless of its source. A citizen harassed through content on a government platform, or by a government account, experiences the same distress as one harassed on a private platform or by a private account.\nI ask the Minister: Why are public agencies exempt from the Commissioner’s enforcement powers and from civil liability? What is the policy rationale for this asymmetry? What recourse will an individual have, if they experience harassment from a rogue public employee, using an official account?\nFifth, engagement reduction and class-of-material directions.\nClause 40 grants the Commissioner power to issue “Engagement Reduction Directions”. This allows the Commissioner to require a service provider to reduce the engagement of end-users with a class of material—without removing it. Clause 41(3) explicitly states it is “not necessary to give any person who may be affected by a Part 5 direction an opportunity to be heard before the direction is given.”\nThis means content posters are not necessarily informed. The content stays online, visible to the poster. It also remains visible to the victim. None will be aware that the content’s reach has been throttled. The victim will continue to see the harm, wondering if their report achieved anything at all.\nMr Speaker, this is a shadow ban.\nSo my question to the Minister is simple: What is the envisaged use of this particular direction? Surely, in cases of legitimate, serious harms, one of the other more forceful directions is the better solution for victims? And if this is meant as a “less forceful” direction, why does the commissioner see the need to intervene at all?\nClause 40, along with clauses 30 and 33, is also a “class of material” direction that raises a related concern. These allow the Commissioner to issue stop communication directions against entire categories of content identified by “specific identifiers”—a username, a term, an online location. There is a high risk that this will function as a digital dragnet that may capture legitimate content alongside harmful material.\nFor example, a victims’ advocacy group reporting on an emerging category of new online harms as a warning to the community, may see their material swept up by mistake.\nOn class-of-material directions, I have two questions: What safeguards exist to prevent over-blocking? And what remedy exists for users whose legitimate content is caught by these directions?\nSixth, and finally, consistency in decision-making.\nParts 10 to 12 of this Bill establish statutory torts that will be adjudicated by courts. These will generate judicial precedents and published decisions. There will be transparency and consistency through the common law process.\nBut Part 5 directions—which may affect just as many people—are quasi-judicial decisions in nature. There is no requirement for published reasons or directions. There is no public record of how the Commissioner interprets and applies the definitions of harms in Part 3 and other sections.\nI ask the Minister two questions:\nFirst: Will the Commissioner be bound by prior decisions that they have made, or will each case be decided on fresh discretion?\nSecondly: Will the Commissioner be bound by clarifications given today in this House? If the Minister states today that Clause 10’s doxxing definition does not capture victims exposing their harassers, can future Commissioners be held to that clarification?\nMr Speaker, this Bill introduces fundamental protections for victims of online harm. We support these protections.\nOur amendments ensure those powers are exercised on evidence, with safeguards for legitimate speech, and with independent judicial oversight. But oversight is meaningless if those affected cannot access it.\nThe Bill’s ambiguities—on doxxing, on standing to appeal, on coverage, on public agency exemptions, on shadow bans, on consistency in decision making—are not minor. They go to the heart of who is protected, who is excluded, and whether this regime operates fairly. I hope that in the course of this debate, that we get clarity and comfort on these questions.\nI urge the Minister to accept our amendments. If the Minister declines, I ask for clear answers to the questions I have raised. Singaporeans deserve a regime that protects victims and respects fairness in equal measure.\n","date":"5 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/evidence-fairness-and-judicial-oversight-strengthening-osra/","section":"Speeches","summary":"","title":"Evidence, fairness, and judicial oversight: strengthening the Online Safety (Relief and Accountability) Bill","type":"speeches"},{"content":"","date":"5 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/legislation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Legislation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/online-safety/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Online Safety","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/technology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/victim-protection/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Victim Protection","type":"tags"},{"content":" A changing world needs a new strategy to not just survive the challenges ahead, but to thrive despite them. A strategy built on security, investment, and trust in our people. Mr Speaker,\nThe world has fundamentally changed. It is a new world fraught with peril, but awash with opportunity. One that needs a new strategy to not just survive the challenges ahead, but to thrive despite them. A strategy built on security, investment, and trust in our people.\nThe ground beneath our feet is shifting # Two great forces define our current moment: the great re-ordering of global power and the artificial intelligence revolution transforming how we work. Together, they represent a convergence of challenges that invite a rethinking of how we approach governance and policy.\nThe World Economic Forum projects that 22% of jobs will undergo structural change by 2030. This is not some distant threat; it is a near-term reality already reshaping our economy. But this AI wave is fundamentally different from previous technological revolutions. Where past disruptions primarily hit the factory floor, this one targets the boardroom, the artist’s studio, the claims desk. From administrative assistants to software developers, from graphic designers to even chief executives—AI capabilities can now match many tasks performed by these workers.\nIn Singapore, this threat is amplified by our unique economic structure. Nearly two-thirds of our workforce are PMETs, precisely the demographic most exposed to AI displacement. Researchers from the International Monetary Fund believe that 60% of jobs in advanced economies will face AI exposure, but for Singapore, this figure is probably higher still. Half of these jobs could benefit from AI integration, boosting productivity and wages. But the other half face automation, creating downward pressure on wages and hiring in these sectors.\nSingapore’s success to date comes from world-class execution of a sound playbook. But as we chart the course for tomorrow, we must question if yesterday’s maps are still relevant for these new waters.\nSecurity: the foundation for a new era # Mr Speaker, I acknowledge the Government’s and Prime Minister’s focus on assurance and cost of living. I agree with the diagnosis, but temporary reliefs are insufficient for the systemic challenges ahead. In our era of AI-driven disruption, we should acknowledge that our existing social safety nets are ill-equipped for the scale of change ahead. A stronger, permanent foundation of security is required. This is not charity—it is the cornerstone of national competitiveness.\nThe impact of this AI revolution can already be felt. Recent surveys of US employers showed 25% of AI users expected to hire fewer workers in the next six months, versus just 10% who intended to hire more. We can already see the same early warning signs here in Singapore. Younger workers, lacking the tacit knowledge that accumulates with experience, are particularly vulnerable to task replacement from AI. This is not a hypothetical disruption. After my party colleague Eileen and I put out a call for feedback a couple of months ago, we have heard from many young Singaporeans, who have shared their stories about struggling to start their careers, struggling with the job search, as well as underemployment concerns.\nSo the first pillar of our new foundation must be Redundancy Insurance for the AI age—not merely job seeker support, but a comprehensive scheme designed for workers facing the reality of career churn in the digital economy. 40% of your last drawn salary, capped at 40% of Singapore’s prevailing median income, for up to six months. The scheme will be funded by small equal contributions from employers and employees amounting to 0.1% of your monthly salary. Not to put that in perspective, for a median income earner that is just over five dollars a month, of which only half is paid by the worker. This creates a true safety net that catches everyone. One that gives workers the confidence to explore new opportunities rather than clinging desperately to dying industries.\nThis represents a profound shift in how we should think about support for the unemployed. In the AI age, career transitions will become the new normal, not the exception. Workers need the security to retrain, to upskill, to reinvent themselves without the spectre of destitution haunting their choices.\nHousing security must also evolve to acknowledge changing aspirations and economic realities. BTO prices should be pegged to a house price-to-income ratio of three for first-time applicants. We should also offer 70-year lease options at lower prices for those who prefer affordability over asset appreciation. The BTO access age for singles should be lowered to 28, and grants should be equalised for single parents who face unique challenges in building stable homes.\nHousing is not merely shelter. It is dignity, stability, and the foundation upon which families build their futures. As someone who has navigated this journey myself recently, I know the anxieties that many young Singaporeans face. When we cannot settle into our first homes until our thirties, we are denied the chance to put down roots—to plan for families—to contribute fully to society’s fabric.\nJust as a home provides foundational security for the family, our economy also requires its own form of security. Platform work has emerged as the primary economic buffer for this era, offering a crucial bridge for those transitioning between traditional jobs. The Platform Workers Act is a commendable first step to shore up this vital economic buffer. But it stops short of addressing algorithmic management—the digital boss that controls every aspect of the platform worker’s existence.\nConcerns about a ‘digital boss’ are not new, but the AI revolution brings a new urgency. These black-box algorithms determine job allocation, pricing, performance evaluation, and even disciplinary action. Recent advancements mean that they could become supercharged —rendering them even more powerful and even more inscrutable than before. Workers deserve to know when AI systems have made decisions about their lives and livelihoods, and they also deserve the right to human review as a fundamental backstop. We cannot allow the digital economy to become a digital dystopia where human dignity is sacrificed at the altar of algorithmic efficiency.\nThe freedom to explore and chase one’s dreams should not be the exclusive playground of the bold or the privileged. By strengthening our foundation of security, every Singaporean will have the licence to try new things. Because should you fail, you will not have too far to fall.\nInvestment: the engine of opportunity # But Mr Speaker, a strong foundation of security is only the first step. To truly thrive, we must build upon it. This brings me to the second pillar of our strategy: investing in our people.\nThe Government has rightly focused its efforts here through SkillsFuture, and recent updates like the Level-Up programme for mid-career workers are positive developments. The ambition is correct. But for all the good intentions, there remains a persistent ‘last-mile disconnect’ between training and employment.\nMany workers still see SkillsFuture as a supermarket of courses—a system that provides plenty of choice, but sometimes lacks clear pathways to career advancement. We hear from those who have diligently completed courses, only to find their new certificates hold little currency with employers—who still prioritise degrees and linear work experience. This is the paradox of our current system: we have built a comprehensive architecture for upskilling, but we have not yet solved the problem of market recognition.\nThe challenge, therefore, is one of pace and integration. Last year, the former Minister for Education articulated a vision for stackable micro-credentials and cross-recognition between our Institutes of Higher Learning. We must accelerate this vision.\nTo start with, as we continue to push our Institutes of Higher Learning to grow their micro-credential offerings, the existing Careers \u0026amp; Skills Passport should evolve from a simple library of certificates, into a dynamic, living credential. A system where micro-credentials from any Institute of Higher Learning can be seamlessly stacked over time. Allowing adult learners to build towards a formal, credible qualification awarded by one of the universities or other IHLs. Backed up by the collective reputations of our renowned institutions, this would go a long way to bridging the disconnect between adult learners and employers. This acknowledges the busy, unpredictable reality of adult life and provides a flexible pathway for all Singaporeans to stay relevant.\nSecondly, we must address the skills gap afflicting our fresh graduates. We possess world-class universities, but we hear of a persistent concern from both employers and graduates themselves. A gap between academic excellence on the one hand and the practical skills that are needed in the modern workplace.\nOur Polytechnics and the Singapore Institute of Technology have proven the value of structured work-integrated learning as a core part of the tertiary curriculum. Given this success, we should push for work-integrated learning to be the norm for as many tertiary students as possible, ensuring our graduates enter the workforce ready to contribute from day one. A targeted grant to help our local SMEs offset the costs of providing such placements could be a powerful catalyst. But crucially, payouts should be structured to incentivise retention and discourage exploitation. This ensures our graduates enter the workforce with the practical, real-world skills that the AI age demands.\nFinally, as we pursue our national AI strategy, we must also ensure its benefits are democratised. SMEs should continue to receive assistance to adopt AI tools. AI literacy should be woven into our school curriculum, and students should be encouraged to command it as a creative and analytical tool. SkillsFuture credits should cover subscriptions to AI assistants and tools, ensuring that all Singaporean workers, regardless of their means, are able to utilise the latest and best tools to drive their own productivity.\nBut above all we must continue to be vigilant to ensure AI serves our workers, not replaces them. In an age of AI, our people’s ability to learn, adapt, and apply knowledge is our single greatest competitive advantage. The right investments in our people will ensure that AI’s promise translates into better wages and better jobs, not just higher profits for shareholders.\nTrust: the courage to be bold # Yet, even the best-laid plans for security and the most ambitious investments in our people will fall short if they are not built on a foundation of mutual respect. And this requires the final, and perhaps most crucial pillar of our strategy: Trust.\nMr Speaker, I welcome the President’s focus on trust as a national priority, but we must be more courageous in our definition of what trust means in a mature democracy.\nTo truly thrive, trust in Singapore must become a two-way street. We have long been asked to trust the government’s judgment, wisdom, and intentions. In this new era, the government must also learn to trust its people with information, with genuine dialogue, and with the fundamental dignity of participation.\nTrust is demonstrated through transparency in governance, and that’s why the Workers’ Party has called for a Freedom of Information Act, which shows we trust citizens with the information necessary to hold the government accountable. When the government holds data that could inform public debate, it should be shared. When policies are formulated based on evidence, that evidence should be accessible to scrutiny.\nTrust is also demonstrated through genuine dialogue rather than managed consultation. Defending robust debate shows we trust the wisdom of our people to engage with complex issues and reach sound judgements. The current Parliamentary committee system, while useful, lacks the teeth necessary for true legislative scrutiny. The Workers’ Party again calls for establishing Standing Select Committees for each ministry, with Members of Parliament from all parties properly resourced to provide meaningful oversight. The government should share information openly with these Committees, not jealously guard it as proprietary knowledge.\nBut the deepest trust of all is demonstrated through permissive discourse. When differences of opinion are tolerated—nay celebrated—in our society, in civil discourse, in the media, in politics. It is why we believe that when disputes over facts arise in our public square, our independent courts and judges should have oversight on what is, or is not, a falsehood.\nTrust is, after all, a two-way street.\nA strategy for a thriving people # Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister has spoken of the need for us to be a ‘We-First’ society. It is a call we can all get behind. But as we heed this call, it is our duty in this House to give this vision meaning for the people we serve.\nSo if by ‘We-First’, the Prime Minister means a secure Singapore where every family has an affordable home and a robust safety net to catch them when they fall, then we are on the same page.\nIf by ‘We-First’, he means investing deeply in the skills and boundless creativity of every Singaporean, then we can work together.\nAnd if by ‘We-First’, he means trusting our people with the freedom to explore, create, and find their own path, then we can take heart.\nThese three pillars—security, investment, and trust—form the foundation of a strategy for a thriving people. A compass for our next chapter. And a promise about the society we can become.\nThank you, Mr Speaker. I support the motion.\n","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/a-strategy-for-a-thriving-people/","section":"Speeches","summary":"","title":"A strategy for a thriving people","type":"speeches"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/education/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Education","type":"tags"},{"content":" A vision for a more creative and innovative Singapore Good evening, friends from across Singapore and residents of Jalan Kayu.\nI stand before you as someone who has walked your corridors, visited your coffee shops, and listened to your hopes and concerns.\nIn my first speech, I spoke about why I decided to step up. In my second, I addressed the crisis of affordability that affects so many Singaporean families.\nTonight, as we approach the final days of this campaign, I want to speak about another crisis facing our nation—a crisis of accountability—and the future we can build together with fresh ideas and new perspectives.\nA different kind of candidate # My opponent has suggested that his NTUC experience and leadership is what Jalan Kayu needs. I respect Mr Ng’s service. But this election isn’t just about experience—it’s about what kind of experience we need in Parliament.\nHe has three stars to his name from his distinguished military career. I have none. But what I offer is something different: a breadth of private sector experience across law, consulting, and technology. Fresh perspectives. New ideas. And most importantly, a commitment to being accountable to you.\nBecause in Singapore today, we need more than just experienced leaders. We need leaders who understand the value of transparency.\nThe accountability crisis # In recent months, Singaporeans have witnessed troubling examples of what happens when accountability is lacking.\nA PAP minister once famously remarked, and I paraphrase, that “no one has asked for an apology.” Well, tonight, let’s ask.\nWhen the SimplyGo rollout left thousands of commuters stranded\u0026hellip;\n[To audience] Where is our apology?\nWhen the East-West line broke down in September, disrupting the lives of countless Singaporeans for days\u0026hellip;\n[To audience] Where is our apology?\nWhen the ACRA Bizfile NRIC scandal exposed our personal data\u0026hellip;\n[To audience] Where is our apology?\nWhen MOE’s vendor Mobile Guardian deleted our children’s critical notes just before exams\u0026hellip;\n[To audience] Where is our apology?\nSometimes apologies do come, but they often feel like “sorry you were affected” rather than genuine accountability.\nThese aren’t just isolated incidents. They reflect a system that has grown too comfortable, too certain of its own infallibility. When even respected figures like former NTUC Income CEO Tan Suee Chieh feel compelled to speak up about governance concerns, we must acknowledge that something needs to change.\nThe Workers’ Party believes in a Singapore where decisions are made transparently, where leaders take responsibility, and where the people’s voice matters.\nEstate management you can trust # To Jalan Kayu residents in the crowd, some may wonder: “Can the Workers’ Party handle town management?”\nLet me be clear: If elected, you will see no disruption in services. The Workers’ Party has proven its ability to run town councils effectively in Aljunied, Hougang, and Sengkang. I will tap into this wealth of experience and hit the ground running from day one.\nI understand your daily concerns—the need for functioning lifts, well-maintained walkways, and clean common spaces. These aren’t just amenities; they’re essential to your quality of life.\nBuilding a better future # Beyond managing our estate, I want to help build a future that works for all Singaporeans.\nA future where education nurtures creativity and critical thinking rather than just producing test-takers. Singapore’s children need an education system that prepares them for tomorrow’s challenges, not yesterday’s. We need broad-based, multidisciplinary learning that encourages exploration and innovation.\nA future where our young people develop an explorer’s mindset—where they connect dots others can’t see and innovate where others see problems. This isn’t about diluting specialisation; it’s about enriching it. It’s about creating thinkers who work across disciplines to address the challenges we will face in an increasingly complex world.\nA future where Singaporeans are empowered with the digital skills and tools they need to thrive in an AI-driven economy. Where SkillsFuture isn’t just about catching up, but about leaping forward.\nA future where we value diverse pathways to success—whether through academia, entrepreneurship, or the trades—recognising that our nation needs all these talents to flourish.\nA voice that speaks for you # In Parliament, I will be a voice that speaks for you. Not just when it’s convenient, but when it matters most.\nI’m not one to mince words when I see something that doesn’t sit quite right with me. And why should I?

We do so by exercising prudence, due diligence, and careful deliberation. If need be, we are ready to work across the aisle, as we always have. This is to ensure that our country does right by you, by our citizens.\nThe choice before us # On the 3rd of May, you have a choice.\nYou can vote for more of the same. Or you can vote for a future where your concerns are heard, where your children have the freedom to explore and create, where your family’s needs come first.\nJalan Kayu deserves a representative who offers fresh perspectives while understanding your daily struggles. Someone who speaks up not to score political points, but to ensure your voice matters in our democracy.\nI am that representative. The Workers’ Party is that alternative.\nMy name is Andre Low.

Tonight, I hope you see me as someone who understands your concerns, shares your hopes, and is ready to fight for our community.\nI’ve spent many hours walking the ground for the past two years. 我看到了你们的困难，也感受到了你们的期望。(I’ve seen your struggles and felt your hopes.)\nAnd what I’ve heard is clear.\nThe affordability crisis # “东西太贵了！”\n“Everything is so expensive now!”\nThis sentiment echoes in almost every conversation. At the kopitiam. At the hawker centre. From retirees, working adults, and young couples alike.\nLet’s be frank. Singapore is becoming unaffordable for ordinary people.\n现在的新加坡，物价越来越高，日子越来越难过。新加坡人的生活负担越来越重。买菜，电费，水费，坐巴士地铁，看医生 — 这些基本生活开销都在上涨。(In today’s Singapore, prices keep rising, and life is getting harder. The burden on ordinary people is too heavy. Groceries, electricity and water bills, bus and MRT fares, seeing the doctor—all these basic living expenses are increasing.)\nYou know what frustrates me? When I hear the Ministries tell us that the inflation rate is falling.\nThe reality feels different. A family visiting the supermarket sees their grocery bill climbing month after month.\nA retiree cuts back on small joys they once took for granted. 辛苦了一辈子的长辈退休后应该过上更舒服的生活。(Our elders who have worked hard for their whole lives deserve to retire in comfort.)\nThis isn’t just about statistics. This is about dignity. This is about whether Singaporeans can afford a decent standard of living in our own country.\nOur approach to affordability # The Workers’ Party has consistently opposed the GST hike. Not because we’re against taxes—we aren’t. But because GST hits lower and middle-income households hardest.\n尤其是对低收入家庭而言，每一毛、每一块钱都很重要。(Especially for low-income families, every dollar, every cent counts.)\nThat 2% increase might seem trivial to those in ivory towers. But for many, it’s the difference between comfort and anxiety.\nWe propose exempting essential items from GST. Basic food items. Utilities. Medicines. Textbooks and school supplies.\nWe want tiered pricing for utilities. Lower consumption means lower rates. This benefits smaller households, seniors, and those who conserve resources.\nWhy should ordinary families bear the same rates as those in GCBs and Black \u0026amp; Whites with wine cellars, home lifts, and multiple air-cons running 24/7? 这公平吗？这合理吗？\nHousing that’s truly affordable and accessible # Housing remains the biggest expense for most Singaporeans. 住房是新加坡人最大的经济负担。年轻人买不起房子，怎么成家立业？怎么规划未来？ (Housing is the biggest financial burden for Singaporeans. If young people can’t afford homes, how can they start families? How can they plan for their future?)\nWait times of 4-5 years for BTO flats? When did this become the norm? When did this become acceptable? In 1989, the wait was just 2-3 years.\nThe government has finally admitted this is a problem. But their solution? \u0026ldquo;Recalibrating\u0026rdquo; to have \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; flats with wait times \u0026ldquo;under three years.\u0026rdquo;\nUnder three years? That should be the maximum, not a goal to aspire to!\nThe Workers’ Party will continue to push the government to bring BTO wait times back to 2-3 years. Not eventually, not gradually, but now!\nWe also believe 28-year-old singles should be allowed to apply for BTO flats, not just those 35 and above.\nIt’s not just singles. Single mothers are considered singles too. They have a family. Why shouldn’t they be able to provide a roof for their children?\nTimes have changed. Policies should change too.\nLet me tell you about a former schoolmate. She\u0026rsquo;s single. She\u0026rsquo;s 34 this yea like me. She earns a good salary. She wants independence. But if she wants a BTO, by the time she actually has a roof over her head, she’ll be pushing 40!\nIs this the Singapore we want? Where hardworking adults don’t even have the dignity of their own space? 这是我们要的新加坡吗？\nAn economy that works for all # These aren’t just isolated policy proposals. They represent a fundamentally different vision for Singapore. A fresh perspective. New ideas.\nThe PAP believes in trickle-down prosperity. Keep the economy growing, and eventually, everyone benefits. But that’s not happening anymore, is it? Our GDP grows, but many Singaporeans feel left behind.\nWe believe in an economy that works for everyone. Where prosperity is measured not just by GDP, but by whether ordinary people can afford to live well.\nThis is why the Workers’ Party is proposing a National Minimum Wage of $1,600. A simple, universal baseline that says: if you work full-time in Singapore, you deserve a living wage.\nA commitment to work # I stand before you tonight not just with words, but with a commitment to work.\nIf elected, I will push relentlessly for these policies in Parliament. I will be your voice when decisions affecting your livelihoods and futures are made.\nI have no doubt that my opponent is a good man. I have nothing against him personally.\nBut he represents a party that has allowed these problems to fester. A party that raised the GST, twice, during a cost-of-living crisis. A party that monitors, while housing prices spiral beyond reach.\nMy friends, on the 3rd of May, you have a choice.\nYou can vote for more of the same. Or you can vote for representatives who will fight for a more affordable Singapore. For a Singapore that truly supports families. For a Singapore that truly cares about its people.\n我们会为你们争取更公平的政策，让每个家庭过上更舒适的生活。(We will fight for fairer policies, so that every household can live a more comfortable life.)\n我是刘宇扬。我是惹兰加由的候选人。I am Andre Low Wu Yang, your Workers’ Party candidate for Jalan Kayu SMC.\nNow, I want to end with this call to action.\nOver the past week, a string of PAP Prime Ministers, past and present, have lined up to ask Singaporeans for a strong mandate.\nI say we send them a strong message!\nVote for change. Vote for hope. Vote for the Workers’ Party!\nJoin us in working for Singapore!\nThank you, and good night! 谢谢大家，晚安！\n","date":"28 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/rally2/","section":"Speeches","summary":"","title":"Second rally speech: The affordability crisis","type":"speeches"},{"content":" Holding those in power to account Good evening, fellow Singaporeans.\nThank you for braving the crowds and the weather to join us tonight. To those watching from home across the island, thank you for your interest in our shared future.\nMy name is Andre Low Wu Yang, and I am your candidate for Jalan Kayu SMC.\nOur team # Look around at the team assembled before you.\nWe are educators, innovators, advocates, professionals.\nWe come from all walks of life. Yet we stand together, united by a vision of a more compassionate Singapore.\nWe are the Workers’ Party team for GE2025.\nWhy I’m here # Why politics? Why opposition politics?\nFor me, it starts with a healthy skepticism, instilled by my parents from an early age. I was taught by them—both teachers—to embrace curiosity. To be bold and question what I was told—even from authority—something I turned back on them quite often!\nThat bold curiosity led me to leave behind a promising career in law to explore technology. To question if the straight and narrow path was right for me.\nThat same bold curiosity is what led me to volunteer with the Workers’ Party, back in 2020.\nBut with my first child due in August, becoming a candidate was an entirely different proposition. How can I be the best father to my daughter, and still give my all to Singapore? But I looked around, and I knew that I could count on my family. My friends. My village.\nWhat also convinced me was remembering those brave explorers who paved the way for us. Mr Low Thia Khiang. J.B. Jeyaretnam. They stepped up when it was unthinkable. They had the iron in them! I have the iron in me!\nThey laid the foundations for me to step up.\nMy commitment to you # Residents of Jalan Kayu and Fernvale, here is my commitment to you.\nI will be a dedicated MP. I will be a present MP.\nI will listen to your concerns, and advocate for you in Parliament.\nI live right next door in Punggol and intend to walk the ground in Jalan Kayu regularly.\nMy father, a design and technology teacher, taught me to be hands-on. We bonded by changing light bulbs, and fixing leaks.\nI will take this same hands-on approach to Jalan Kayu and Fernvale. I set up the Meet-the-People sessions from scratch in Rivervale! If elected, my team and I will do the same in Jalan Kayu. We will hit the ground running from day 1!\nWhat I stand for # Let me share what I stand for.\nFirst, I stand for making life more affordable for every Singaporean household. Rising prices are squeezing family budgets. The GST increase to 9%, high utility bills, and escalating costs are making life harder. We need practical solutions like exempting essential goods from GST. Tiered pricing for utilities. Free off-peak public transport for our seniors and pioneers!\nSecond, I stand for supporting younger Singaporeans and families. Housing remains a top concern. We need a clear affordability metric for BTO pricing, to allow singles to apply for flats earlier, and to bring wait times back to what they were decades ago.\nThird, I stand for education that nurtures creativity and critical thinking for our youngest minds. We must reduce examination pressure. Cap class sizes. Start schools later so that our children can relax at the end of a school day. And encourage our youth to be bold and explore!\nFourth, I stand for future-ready jobs and skills. In a rapidly evolving economy, Singaporeans need both protection during transitions and support to develop new skills. We need mandatory retrenchment benefits, and improved access to upskilling programs.\nStanding up for accountability # But most importantly, I stand for Singapore. And standing for Singapore means holding those in power to account.\nThat is why, when Pritam needed someone to step up and contest in Jalan Kayu, I put myself forward.\nIn July last year, a deal was announced to sell a majority stake in our homegrown NTUC Income to German multinational Allianz. What we did not know at the time was that it included a plan to return $1.85 billion to shareholders—including Allianz itself—within three years.\nDespite public assurances that Income’s social mission would be protected, there was little that I could see in the way of concrete legally binding safeguards in the offer.\nRemember, Income was built on the backs of ordinary Singaporeans, with a mission to serve our local community and provide affordable insurance to those who could not get it elsewhere. A few years ago, it was allowed to convert from a cooperative to a company with the understanding it would remain committed to this mission. Yet barely two years later, the NTUC was prepared to approve this troubling deal. Even Professor Tommy Koh, the esteemed Professor Tommy Koh spoke out publicly against it!\nIn August, the NTUC issued a statement supporting the deal, claiming that Income needed access to additional resources to fulfil its social mission. Yet according to NTUC Deputy Secretary-General Desmond Tan’s statement in Parliament on 16 October, the NTUC central committee was unaware of the capital extraction plan until it was revealed in Parliament on 14 October.\nLet me ask you this: Is this what we deserve? Is this the leadership we want?\nThe situation was so serious that the previous administration had to pass emergency laws to block the deal. A deal that the NTUC had publicly endorsed just months before. This despite the NTUC’s close relationship with the PAP.\nThis is why we need strong opposition voices in Parliament. Because without proper checks and balances, without proper oversight, without people willing to challenge those in power, these kinds of decisions get made behind closed doors. We were so lucky that the NTUC Income-Allianz deal was blocked. We may not be so lucky again.\nI promise you this: if elected, I will never plead ignorance. I will never say ‘I didn\u0026rsquo;t know’ when it comes to matters affecting Singaporeans’ livelihoods and future. I will ask the hard questions before decisions are made, not after the damage is done.\nThe Singapore I envision and a commitment to serve # Because I want a Singapore where your voice matters.\nA Singapore where progress means everyone moves forward together.\nI believe this is the Singapore that you want too.\nResidents of Jalan Kayu and Fernvale, I invite you to vote for me, Andre Low, and vote for the Workers\u0026rsquo; Party!\nTogether, let us build a Singapore we can all be proud of.\nThank you.\nPhoto credit: Thank you Edwin Koo @singaporeson for the cover photo\n","date":"24 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/rally1/","section":"Speeches","summary":"","title":"First rally speech: Standing up for accountability","type":"speeches"},{"content":" My journey in blue. When I first joined the Workers’ Party as a volunteer in 2020, I could not have imagined where this path would lead. Those early days were a blur—distributing flyers in Aljunied GRC during the hustings, having countless doorstep conversations reassuring voters about ballot secrecy, and serving as a polling agent on election day. What began as a desire to make a small contribution to a more balanced political landscape transformed into something much deeper when our unexpected Sengkang GRC win changed everything. Suddenly, I found myself assigned as Secretarial Assistant to MP Louis Chua, facing the real responsibility of serving Singaporeans.\nPolitics is not just about policies—it is about people\nThose three years running Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) proved to be the most formative experience of my political journey. Each resident who walked through our doors left an imprint—young single parents juggling work and childcare, seniors navigating our healthcare system, families caught between policy gaps. Each successful appeal gave me added drive, but equally every resident we could not assist in a meaningful way left me feeling helpless—trapped by an imperfect system. With COVID in full force, we had to hit the ground running, and the digital MPS system I built continues to serve the Sengkang community today. Alongside our MPS work, I dived into grassroots activities with Louis and the other Sengkang MPs, Ting Ru, and Jamus—food distribution drives, community events, and the uniquely WP experience of selling our Hammer newsletter at hawker centres and markets.\nSelling the Hammer newsletter at Tampines Round Market with my fellow legally-trained WP members As career demands shifted, so did my contributions. Joining the WP media team allowed me to apply my professional experience in new ways, leading the modernisation of our digital presence, and refining our media strategy and messaging. February this year saw the launch of our new website after months of careful work. Over the past couple of years, I’ve also had the privilege of building up our presence and core volunteer team in Tampines as the party seeks to break new ground in the upcoming election.\nI could not ask for a better team in Tampines! Each step—from nervous first-time volunteer to where I stand today—has deepened my conviction that Singapore benefits from diverse political voices. This journey has taught me that political participation is not just about policies—it is about people. It is about listening to the elderly uncle worried about healthcare costs, the young couple struggling with housing prices, the mid-career PMET anxious about job security. If these stories resonate with you, I invite you to step up with us. From house visits to polling duties, every role matters—and no experience is needed, just heart and commitment. Whether you can offer time, energy, or resources, your support makes a difference in building a more balanced political system and a brighter future for all Singaporeans. Step up. Make a difference. Walk with us.\n#StepUp with the Workers\u0026rsquo; Party # Answer the call:\nVolunteer ","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/thoughts/stepping-up/","section":"Thoughts","summary":"","title":"Stepping up","type":"thoughts"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/stepup/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"StepUp","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/thoughts/","section":"Thoughts","summary":"","title":"Thoughts","type":"thoughts"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/volunteering/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Volunteering","type":"tags"},{"content":" About me # Low Wu Yang Andre\n刘宇扬\n34 years old\nMarried, with one child\nBio # An only child to two MOE teachers, I was taught from a young age to embrace curiosity and ask questions of the world around me.\nToday, I am stepping up to build a better future for Singapore, one that embraces diverse perspectives, dares to dream and experiment, and makes sure no Singaporean is ever left behind.\nI am humbled to be given the opportunity to serve as an NCMP.
