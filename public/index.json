[{"content":" A vision for a more creative and innovative Singapore Good evening, friends from across Singapore and residents of Jalan Kayu.\nI stand before you as someone who has walked your corridors, visited your coffee shops, and listened to your hopes and concerns.\nIn my first speech, I spoke about why I decided to step up. In my second, I addressed the crisis of affordability that affects so many Singaporean families.\nTonight, as we approach the final days of this campaign, I want to speak about another crisis facing our nation—a crisis of accountability—and the future we can build together with fresh ideas and new perspectives.\nA different kind of candidate # My opponent has suggested that his NTUC experience and leadership is what Jalan Kayu needs. I respect Mr Ng’s service. But this election isn’t just about experience—it’s about what kind of experience we need in Parliament.\nHe has three stars to his name from his distinguished military career. I have none. But what I offer is something different: a breadth of private sector experience across law, consulting, and technology. Fresh perspectives. New ideas. And most importantly, a commitment to being accountable to you.\nBecause in Singapore today, we need more than just experienced leaders. We need leaders who understand the value of transparency.\nThe accountability crisis # In recent months, Singaporeans have witnessed troubling examples of what happens when accountability is lacking.\nA PAP minister once famously remarked, and I paraphrase, that “no one has asked for an apology.” Well, tonight, let’s ask.\nWhen the SimplyGo rollout left thousands of commuters stranded\u0026hellip;\n[To audience] Where is our apology?\nWhen the East-West line broke down in September, disrupting the lives of countless Singaporeans for days\u0026hellip;\n[To audience] Where is our apology?\nWhen the ACRA Bizfile NRIC scandal exposed our personal data\u0026hellip;\n[To audience] Where is our apology?\nWhen MOE’s vendor Mobile Guardian deleted our children’s critical notes just before exams\u0026hellip;\n[To audience] Where is our apology?\nSometimes apologies do come, but they often feel like “sorry you were affected” rather than genuine accountability.\nThese aren’t just isolated incidents. They reflect a system that has grown too comfortable, too certain of its own infallibility. When even respected figures like former NTUC Income CEO Tan Suee Chieh feel compelled to speak up about governance concerns, we must acknowledge that something needs to change.\nThe Workers’ Party believes in a Singapore where decisions are made transparently, where leaders take responsibility, and where the people’s voice matters.\nEstate management you can trust # To Jalan Kayu residents in the crowd, some may wonder: “Can the Workers’ Party handle town management?”\nLet me be clear: If elected, you will see no disruption in services. The Workers’ Party has proven its ability to run town councils effectively in Aljunied, Hougang, and Sengkang. I will tap into this wealth of experience and hit the ground running from day one.\nI understand your daily concerns—the need for functioning lifts, well-maintained walkways, and clean common spaces. These aren’t just amenities; they’re essential to your quality of life.\nBuilding a better future # Beyond managing our estate, I want to help build a future that works for all Singaporeans.\nA future where education nurtures creativity and critical thinking rather than just producing test-takers. Singapore’s children need an education system that prepares them for tomorrow’s challenges, not yesterday’s. We need broad-based, multidisciplinary learning that encourages exploration and innovation.\nA future where our young people develop an explorer’s mindset—where they connect dots others can’t see and innovate where others see problems. This isn’t about diluting specialisation; it’s about enriching it. It’s about creating thinkers who work across disciplines to address the challenges we will face in an increasingly complex world.\nA future where Singaporeans are empowered with the digital skills and tools they need to thrive in an AI-driven economy. Where SkillsFuture isn’t just about catching up, but about leaping forward.\nA future where we value diverse pathways to success—whether through academia, entrepreneurship, or the trades—recognising that our nation needs all these talents to flourish.\nA voice that speaks for you # In Parliament, I will be a voice that speaks for you. Not just when it’s convenient, but when it matters most.\nI’m not one to mince words when I see something that doesn’t sit quite right with me. And why should I? Singaporeans deserve someone who will ask the tough questions, someone who will speak up when others stay silent.\nWhen bills are rushed through without adequate scrutiny, I will ask the hard questions.\nWhen policies benefit the wealthy while burdening ordinary Singaporeans, I will stand firm.\nAnd when government agencies make mistakes that affect your lives, I will demand accountability—not out of spite, but because you deserve nothing less.\nWe navigate uncertainty not by how fast we pass laws or how many laws we pass. We do so by exercising prudence, due diligence, and careful deliberation. If need be, we are ready to work across the aisle, as we always have. This is to ensure that our country does right by you, by our citizens.\nThe choice before us # On the 3rd of May, you have a choice.\nYou can vote for more of the same. Or you can vote for a future where your concerns are heard, where your children have the freedom to explore and create, where your family’s needs come first.\nJalan Kayu deserves a representative who offers fresh perspectives while understanding your daily struggles. Someone who speaks up not to score political points, but to ensure your voice matters in our democracy.\nI am that representative. The Workers’ Party is that alternative.\nMy name is Andre Low. I’m offering something different—accountability, transparency, and a genuine commitment to serving you and your families.\nVote for change. Vote for hope. Vote for the Workers’ Party, and join us in working for Singapore!\nThank you.\n","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/rally3/","section":"Speeches","summary":"A vision for a more creative and innovative Singapore Good evening, friends from across Singapore and residents of Jalan Kayu.","title":"Final rally speech: Building a better future for Singapore","type":"speeches"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ge2025/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GE2025","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/notwhite/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NotWhite","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rallies/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rallies","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/","section":"Speeches","summary":"","title":"Speeches","type":"speeches"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/workingforsingapore/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"WorkingForSingapore","type":"tags"},{"content":" Keeping Singapore affordable for everyday Singaporeans Good evening, my friends and neighbours.\n各位朋友，各位邻居，晚上好。\n(Punggol joke)\nLast week, I stood before you as a stranger. Tonight, I hope you see me as someone who understands your concerns, shares your hopes, and is ready to fight for our community.\nI’ve spent many hours walking the ground for the past two years. 我看到了你们的困难，也感受到了你们的期望。(I’ve seen your struggles and felt your hopes.)\nAnd what I’ve heard is clear.\nThe affordability crisis # “东西太贵了！”\n“Everything is so expensive now!”\nThis sentiment echoes in almost every conversation. At the kopitiam. At the hawker centre. From retirees, working adults, and young couples alike.\nLet’s be frank. Singapore is becoming unaffordable for ordinary people.\n现在的新加坡，物价越来越高，日子越来越难过。新加坡人的生活负担越来越重。买菜，电费，水费，坐巴士地铁，看医生 — 这些基本生活开销都在上涨。(In today’s Singapore, prices keep rising, and life is getting harder. The burden on ordinary people is too heavy. Groceries, electricity and water bills, bus and MRT fares, seeing the doctor—all these basic living expenses are increasing.)\nYou know what frustrates me? When I hear the Ministries tell us that the inflation rate is falling.\nThe reality feels different. A family visiting the supermarket sees their grocery bill climbing month after month.\nA retiree cuts back on small joys they once took for granted. 辛苦了一辈子的长辈退休后应该过上更舒服的生活。(Our elders who have worked hard for their whole lives deserve to retire in comfort.)\nThis isn’t just about statistics. This is about dignity. This is about whether Singaporeans can afford a decent standard of living in our own country.\nOur approach to affordability # The Workers’ Party has consistently opposed the GST hike. Not because we’re against taxes—we aren’t. But because GST hits lower and middle-income households hardest.\n尤其是对低收入家庭而言，每一毛、每一块钱都很重要。(Especially for low-income families, every dollar, every cent counts.)\nThat 2% increase might seem trivial to those in ivory towers. But for many, it’s the difference between comfort and anxiety.\nWe propose exempting essential items from GST. Basic food items. Utilities. Medicines. Textbooks and school supplies.\nWe want tiered pricing for utilities. Lower consumption means lower rates. This benefits smaller households, seniors, and those who conserve resources.\nWhy should ordinary families bear the same rates as those in GCBs and Black \u0026amp; Whites with wine cellars, home lifts, and multiple air-cons running 24/7? 这公平吗？这合理吗？\nHousing that’s truly affordable and accessible # Housing remains the biggest expense for most Singaporeans. 住房是新加坡人最大的经济负担。年轻人买不起房子，怎么成家立业？怎么规划未来？ (Housing is the biggest financial burden for Singaporeans. If young people can’t afford homes, how can they start families? How can they plan for their future?)\nWait times of 4-5 years for BTO flats? When did this become the norm? When did this become acceptable? In 1989, the wait was just 2-3 years.\nThe government has finally admitted this is a problem. But their solution? \u0026ldquo;Recalibrating\u0026rdquo; to have \u0026ldquo;more\u0026rdquo; flats with wait times \u0026ldquo;under three years.\u0026rdquo;\nUnder three years? That should be the maximum, not a goal to aspire to!\nThe Workers’ Party will continue to push the government to bring BTO wait times back to 2-3 years. Not eventually, not gradually, but now!\nWe also believe 28-year-old singles should be allowed to apply for BTO flats, not just those 35 and above.\nIt’s not just singles. Single mothers are considered singles too. They have a family. Why shouldn’t they be able to provide a roof for their children?\nTimes have changed. Policies should change too.\nLet me tell you about a former schoolmate. She\u0026rsquo;s single. She\u0026rsquo;s 34 this yea like me. She earns a good salary. She wants independence. But if she wants a BTO, by the time she actually has a roof over her head, she’ll be pushing 40!\nIs this the Singapore we want? Where hardworking adults don’t even have the dignity of their own space? 这是我们要的新加坡吗？\nAn economy that works for all # These aren’t just isolated policy proposals. They represent a fundamentally different vision for Singapore. A fresh perspective. New ideas.\nThe PAP believes in trickle-down prosperity. Keep the economy growing, and eventually, everyone benefits. But that’s not happening anymore, is it? Our GDP grows, but many Singaporeans feel left behind.\nWe believe in an economy that works for everyone. Where prosperity is measured not just by GDP, but by whether ordinary people can afford to live well.\nThis is why the Workers’ Party is proposing a National Minimum Wage of $1,600. A simple, universal baseline that says: if you work full-time in Singapore, you deserve a living wage.\nA commitment to work # I stand before you tonight not just with words, but with a commitment to work.\nIf elected, I will push relentlessly for these policies in Parliament. I will be your voice when decisions affecting your livelihoods and futures are made.\nI have no doubt that my opponent is a good man. I have nothing against him personally.\nBut he represents a party that has allowed these problems to fester. A party that raised the GST, twice, during a cost-of-living crisis. A party that monitors, while housing prices spiral beyond reach.\nMy friends, on the 3rd of May, you have a choice.\nYou can vote for more of the same. Or you can vote for representatives who will fight for a more affordable Singapore. For a Singapore that truly supports families. For a Singapore that truly cares about its people.\n我们会为你们争取更公平的政策，让每个家庭过上更舒适的生活。(We will fight for fairer policies, so that every household can live a more comfortable life.)\n我是刘宇扬。我是惹兰加由的候选人。I am Andre Low Wu Yang, your Workers’ Party candidate for Jalan Kayu SMC.\nNow, I want to end with this call to action.\nOver the past week, a string of PAP Prime Ministers, past and present, have lined up to ask Singaporeans for a strong mandate.\nI say we send them a strong message!\nVote for change. Vote for hope. Vote for the Workers’ Party!\nJoin us in working for Singapore!\nThank you, and good night! 谢谢大家，晚安！\n","date":"28 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/rally2/","section":"Speeches","summary":"Keeping Singapore affordable for everyday Singaporeans Good evening, my friends and neighbours.","title":"Second rally speech: The affordability crisis","type":"speeches"},{"content":" Holding those in power to account Good evening, fellow Singaporeans.\nThank you for braving the crowds and the weather to join us tonight. To those watching from home across the island, thank you for your interest in our shared future.\nMy name is Andre Low Wu Yang, and I am your candidate for Jalan Kayu SMC.\nOur team # Look around at the team assembled before you.\nWe are educators, innovators, advocates, professionals.\nWe come from all walks of life. Yet we stand together, united by a vision of a more compassionate Singapore.\nWe are the Workers’ Party team for GE2025.\nWhy I’m here # Why politics? Why opposition politics?\nFor me, it starts with a healthy skepticism, instilled by my parents from an early age. I was taught by them—both teachers—to embrace curiosity. To be bold and question what I was told—even from authority—something I turned back on them quite often!\nThat bold curiosity led me to leave behind a promising career in law to explore technology. To question if the straight and narrow path was right for me.\nThat same bold curiosity is what led me to volunteer with the Workers’ Party, back in 2020.\nBut with my first child due in August, becoming a candidate was an entirely different proposition. How can I be the best father to my daughter, and still give my all to Singapore? But I looked around, and I knew that I could count on my family. My friends. My village.\nWhat also convinced me was remembering those brave explorers who paved the way for us. Mr Low Thia Khiang. J.B. Jeyaretnam. They stepped up when it was unthinkable. They had the iron in them! I have the iron in me!\nThey laid the foundations for me to step up.\nMy commitment to you # Residents of Jalan Kayu and Fernvale, here is my commitment to you.\nI will be a dedicated MP. I will be a present MP.\nI will listen to your concerns, and advocate for you in Parliament.\nI live right next door in Punggol and intend to walk the ground in Jalan Kayu regularly.\nMy father, a design and technology teacher, taught me to be hands-on. We bonded by changing light bulbs, and fixing leaks.\nI will take this same hands-on approach to Jalan Kayu and Fernvale. I set up the Meet-the-People sessions from scratch in Rivervale! If elected, my team and I will do the same in Jalan Kayu. We will hit the ground running from day 1!\nWhat I stand for # Let me share what I stand for.\nFirst, I stand for making life more affordable for every Singaporean household. Rising prices are squeezing family budgets. The GST increase to 9%, high utility bills, and escalating costs are making life harder. We need practical solutions like exempting essential goods from GST. Tiered pricing for utilities. Free off-peak public transport for our seniors and pioneers!\nSecond, I stand for supporting younger Singaporeans and families. Housing remains a top concern. We need a clear affordability metric for BTO pricing, to allow singles to apply for flats earlier, and to bring wait times back to what they were decades ago.\nThird, I stand for education that nurtures creativity and critical thinking for our youngest minds. We must reduce examination pressure. Cap class sizes. Start schools later so that our children can relax at the end of a school day. And encourage our youth to be bold and explore!\nFourth, I stand for future-ready jobs and skills. In a rapidly evolving economy, Singaporeans need both protection during transitions and support to develop new skills. We need mandatory retrenchment benefits, and improved access to upskilling programs.\nStanding up for accountability # But most importantly, I stand for Singapore. And standing for Singapore means holding those in power to account.\nThat is why, when Pritam needed someone to step up and contest in Jalan Kayu, I put myself forward.\nIn July last year, a deal was announced to sell a majority stake in our homegrown NTUC Income to German multinational Allianz. What we did not know at the time was that it included a plan to return $1.85 billion to shareholders—including Allianz itself—within three years.\nDespite public assurances that Income’s social mission would be protected, there was little that I could see in the way of concrete legally binding safeguards in the offer.\nRemember, Income was built on the backs of ordinary Singaporeans, with a mission to serve our local community and provide affordable insurance to those who could not get it elsewhere. A few years ago, it was allowed to convert from a cooperative to a company with the understanding it would remain committed to this mission. Yet barely two years later, the NTUC was prepared to approve this troubling deal. Even Professor Tommy Koh, the esteemed Professor Tommy Koh spoke out publicly against it!\nIn August, the NTUC issued a statement supporting the deal, claiming that Income needed access to additional resources to fulfil its social mission. Yet according to NTUC Deputy Secretary-General Desmond Tan’s statement in Parliament on 16 October, the NTUC central committee was unaware of the capital extraction plan until it was revealed in Parliament on 14 October.\nLet me ask you this: Is this what we deserve? Is this the leadership we want?\nThe situation was so serious that the previous administration had to pass emergency laws to block the deal. A deal that the NTUC had publicly endorsed just months before. This despite the NTUC’s close relationship with the PAP.\nThis is why we need strong opposition voices in Parliament. Because without proper checks and balances, without proper oversight, without people willing to challenge those in power, these kinds of decisions get made behind closed doors. We were so lucky that the NTUC Income-Allianz deal was blocked. We may not be so lucky again.\nI promise you this: if elected, I will never plead ignorance. I will never say ‘I didn\u0026rsquo;t know’ when it comes to matters affecting Singaporeans’ livelihoods and future. I will ask the hard questions before decisions are made, not after the damage is done.\nThe Singapore I envision and a commitment to serve # Because I want a Singapore where your voice matters.\nA Singapore where progress means everyone moves forward together.\nI believe this is the Singapore that you want too.\nResidents of Jalan Kayu and Fernvale, I invite you to vote for me, Andre Low, and vote for the Workers\u0026rsquo; Party!\nTogether, let us build a Singapore we can all be proud of.\nThank you.\nPhoto credit: Thank you Edwin Koo @singaporeson for the cover photo\n","date":"24 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/speeches/rally1/","section":"Speeches","summary":"Holding those in power to account Good evening, fellow Singaporeans.","title":"First rally speech: Standing up for accountability","type":"speeches"},{"content":" My journey in blue. When I first joined the Workers’ Party as a volunteer in 2020, I could not have imagined where this path would lead. Those early days were a blur—distributing flyers in Aljunied GRC during the hustings, having countless doorstep conversations reassuring voters about ballot secrecy, and serving as a polling agent on election day. What began as a desire to make a small contribution to a more balanced political landscape transformed into something much deeper when our unexpected Sengkang GRC win changed everything. Suddenly, I found myself assigned as Secretarial Assistant to MP Louis Chua, facing the real responsibility of serving Singaporeans.\nPolitics is not just about policies—it is about people\nThose three years running Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) proved to be the most formative experience of my political journey. Each resident who walked through our doors left an imprint—young single parents juggling work and childcare, seniors navigating our healthcare system, families caught between policy gaps. Each successful appeal gave me added drive, but equally every resident we could not assist in a meaningful way left me feeling helpless—trapped by an imperfect system. With COVID in full force, we had to hit the ground running, and the digital MPS system I built continues to serve the Sengkang community today. Alongside our MPS work, I dived into grassroots activities with Louis and the other Sengkang MPs, Ting Ru, and Jamus—food distribution drives, community events, and the uniquely WP experience of selling our Hammer newsletter at hawker centres and markets.\nSelling the Hammer newsletter at Tampines Round Market with my fellow legally-trained WP members As career demands shifted, so did my contributions. Joining the WP media team allowed me to apply my professional experience in new ways, leading the modernisation of our digital presence, and refining our media strategy and messaging. February this year saw the launch of our new website after months of careful work. Over the past couple of years, I’ve also had the privilege of building up our presence and core volunteer team in Tampines as the party seeks to break new ground in the upcoming election.\nI could not ask for a better team in Tampines! Each step—from nervous first-time volunteer to where I stand today—has deepened my conviction that Singapore benefits from diverse political voices. This journey has taught me that political participation is not just about policies—it is about people. It is about listening to the elderly uncle worried about healthcare costs, the young couple struggling with housing prices, the mid-career PMET anxious about job security. If these stories resonate with you, I invite you to step up with us. From house visits to polling duties, every role matters—and no experience is needed, just heart and commitment. Whether you can offer time, energy, or resources, your support makes a difference in building a more balanced political system and a brighter future for all Singaporeans. Step up. Make a difference. Walk with us.\n#StepUp with the Workers\u0026rsquo; Party # Answer the call:\nVolunteer ","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/thoughts/stepping-up/","section":"Thoughts","summary":"My journey in blue.","title":"Stepping up","type":"thoughts"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/stepup/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"StepUp","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/thoughts/","section":"Thoughts","summary":"","title":"Thoughts","type":"thoughts"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/volunteering/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Volunteering","type":"tags"},{"content":" About me # Low Wu Yang Andre\n刘宇扬\n34 years old\nMarried, with one child on the way\nBio # An only child to two MOE teachers, I was taught from a young age to embrace curiosity and ask questions of the world around me.\nToday, I am stepping up to build a better future for Singapore, one that embraces diverse perspectives, dares to dream and experiment, and makes sure no Singaporean is ever left behind.\nFind me on LinkedIn\nCareer highlights # Education # ","date":"14 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about-me/","section":"","summary":"About me # Low Wu Yang Andre","title":"Andre Low","type":"page"},{"content":" Dear residents of Jalan Kayu and Fernvale, I am Andre, your Workers\u0026rsquo; Party candidate for Jalan Kayu SMC.\nAn only child to two teachers, I was taught from a young age to embrace curiosity and ask questions of the world around me.\nToday, I am stepping up to build a better future for Singapore, one that embraces diverse perspectives, dares to dream and experiment, and makes sure no Singaporean is ever left behind.\nGet to know me ","date":"14 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"Dear residents of Jalan Kayu and Fernvale, I am Andre, your Workers\u0026rsquo; Party candidate for Jalan Kayu SMC.","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
